Distributed databases help to store and query more securely and reliably. A distributed database stores files and data across different physical locations on the same or disparate networks. Distributed database systems help you innovate and cope with growing data needs by scaling effortlessly.

Instead of limiting data storage and transaction processing to one machine, distributed database utilizes multiple machines across different loactions. This, in turn , increases performance, data recovery and general user experience.

1. Clusterpoint

    Clusterpoint is a schema-free ingerated database solution for distributed data. It is a robust data storage and querying solution with flexibility, scalability, high availablity, and cost-effectiveness. It is ideal for storing data in financial services, healthcare, telecommunication, and other data-intensive industries.

2. ETCD 

    ETCD is an opensource key-value data storage solution for large-scale distributed systems information. It stores the configurations, state, and metadata for distributed environments like Kubernetes in a consistent and highly available manner. The CNCF project offers a simple interface that enables reads and writes using standard tools such as curl. It is ideal for storing critical information in production systems such as container schedulers, services and kubernetes.

3. CockroachDB

    CockroachDB is a cloud native commercial distributed database developed by Cockroach Labs. It is a distributed SQL database built for transactional and consistent key-value stores, highly compatible with cloud native applications with the speed and scalability of large datasets.CockroachDB stores SpaceX operational data and are ideal for low latency, resilent storage in global applications.
